# To Do List for Support Vector Machine

## SVC

### Names

- The names from Wiki, *An Introduction to Statistical Learning with R*, *Elements of Statistical Learning* are not the same. Use names from Wiki and materials from *Introduction* until now. 

### Principles and Models

- Nonlinear: no understanding of how the linear model can be expressed by inner product of training data;
- Multiple classes: no materials introducting different methods of multiple classes classification;
- One class: no materials.

### Python Implements

- The reasons that the implements of **SVR** and **LinearSVR** predict different results need to be researched;
- No materials for **NuSVC**

### Economic Application

- No reading the reference materials.


## SVR

### Principles and Models

- No understanding the methods of support vector regression.

### Economic Application

- No understanding
